# clean-node
A "simple" CRUD API built following the clean architecture's guidelines

The code is designed to be used with SQL as well as NoSQL databases (Postgres, MongoDB) and the use of either one can be switched to by editing the "DATABASE_IN_USE" variable inside the `src/config/ENV_global.ts` file.
